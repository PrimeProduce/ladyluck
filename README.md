# silent_airtable_auction

Single page Vue.js app running off of Airtable's API.
Refreshes every 30 secs.

*NOTE*: This leaves your Airtable API key exposed client-side. 
Quick solution: use this with an Airtable account that is read-only for all the databases it has access to. Assume that all of the databases it has access to are meant to be publicly viewable

### How to get started

1. Open this page in a browser (tested on Google Chrome). This should work without any server, etc.
2. Done!
